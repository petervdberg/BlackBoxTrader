# BlackBoxTrader
In his book "Inside the black box" Rishi Narang describes a general framework for quantitative trading. Following his description, I created this framwork such that it can be used to implement any trading strategy, really.

I have create implementations in two different languages:
- One in MQL4 for MetaTrader 4
- One in NinjaScript (C#) for NinjaTrader
